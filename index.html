        <li><strong>What is DOM?</strong></li>
        <div>
          -DOM stands for DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL. It is how web browsers
          represent internally.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          i)<strong>Document -</strong> we can think of document as any piece of
          papers that represents a certain information like books , articles,
          etc. In case of web developers a document is a name for web page
        </div>
        <br />

        <div>
          ii)<strong>Object -</strong> The things which are on web pages
          (Documents) are called objects sometimes called elements or nodes.
          examples:- <br /><strong>----Content:-</strong> The most obvious
          objects on a web page are the content. These can include words,
          videos, images, and more. <br />
          <strong>----Elements:-</strong> These include divs, containers, and
          sections. You may not see these elements, but you see how they affect
          the visible elements because they organize those elements on the web
          page.<br />
          <strong>----Attributes:-</strong> Every element on a web page has
          attributes.These include classes, styles, and sizes for example. These
          are objects in the DOM, but they dont have features like contents and
          elements.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          iii)<strong>Model -</strong> A model is a representation of something,
          and it helps us understand how something is put together. There are
          models for many things that need to be universally understood,
          analyzed, and used.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <strong> So what exactly is a DOM? </strong><br />
          The DOM is represented as a type of data structure called a tree.
          Every object in the DOM is hierarchically under another object, and
          any object can have multiple children but only one parent.
        </div>
        <br />

        <li><strong>What is an API?</strong></li>
        <div>
          <strong>API</strong> stands for
          <strong>Application Programming Interface.</strong>
          API is a set of routine, protocol and tools for building software
          applications. It basically connects two diffrent set of programs or
          data which gives an interaction between them. Basically connecting
          server-side to client side.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong>What do you mean by semantic HTML ?</strong></li>
        <div>
          We can structure a HTML page anyhow without caring about its meaning
          the output will be same there will be no major changes in it but at
          the same time the meaning of the page might be misaligned for e.g:-
          <br />
          <pre><code>&lt;H1&gt;FOO&lt;H1&gt; &lt;p&gt;FOO&lt;p&gt;
          </code></pre>
          We can use both H1 and P tags for heading by increasing the size of
          text of p tag but this might result in wrong meaning, We can use label
          tag for better understanding for visually impared persons. The tag
          will be recognized by the browser and will read it's content. for
          e.g:- <br />
          <pre><code>&lt;label for="FOO"&gt;FOO&lt;H1&gt;</code></pre>
        </div>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong
            >What is the diffrence between inline and inline-block?</strong
          >
        </li>

        <div>
          First lets understand what is inline and block element.<br />
          <strong>Inline elements:-</strong>There is no line break around this
          element if you place another line ahead or behind of it, the element
          or the line will continue from there only. In short the element just
          takes it's own content's space.<br />
          <strong>Block elements:-</strong>Block element does'nt let another
          line or tag interupt with it's spacing. In short it applies a line
          break after and before the element.
          <br />
          <strong>Inline-Block elements:-</strong>
          By default we can't alter or reset the margin or padding for up and
          bottom of the inline element that's where Inline-Block comes to use we
          can alter inline-block's margin and padding.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong>What are promises?</strong></li>
        <div>
          Javascript is an <strong>interpreted language</strong> what that means
          is that it executes code line by line thus it cannot perform
          multi-tasking so it uses it's <strong>asynchronous</strong> computing
          feature and by using it. It promises that when the value is obtained
          or the data is fetched it will be returning the value or an error
          promises has three states resolved, pending and rejected.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>
            What are the ways of linking stylesheet to HTML file ?
          </strong>
        </li>
        <div>
          We can link a css file in HTML in three ways:- <br />
          i) inline css :- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
          <br />
          ii) internal css :- by using a &lt;style&gt; element in the
          &lt;head&gt; section <br />
          iii) external css :- by using a &lt;link&gt; element to link to an
          external CSS file
        </div>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Consequences of placing script tag inside head ?</strong>
        </li>
        <div>
          The script tag should be placed above the closing body tag after
          writting all the HTML code. <br />
          If the script tag is used in head the HTML code will not be executed.
          <br />
          Same goes for if the script tag is placed in between of the HTML code.
          In this case script could only read the code written above it.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong>Differences between Vanila JS & React JS ?</strong></li>
        <div>
          --React is a framework which is written in javascript language.
          whereas javascript is a programming language. <br />
          --While we can write all the UI using javascript but we can write
          efficient code using react with the help of components, Components can
          be reused thus saves a lot of time for e.g if we design a certain
          "like button" for a app we can use it in diffrent pages without
          writing again. <br />
          --Using React we can built single-page appliction which means there is
          no reloading while going for next page. <br />
          --Javascript uses Actual DOM and react uses virtual DOM <br />
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong>What is Git?</strong></li>
        <div>
          Git is a version control tool which helps us to manage our code and
          modify the code in github accordingly. We can use git through Command
          Line Interface. It makes it way easier to work collabotratively with
          other developers.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong>What is Github?</strong></li>
        <div>
          Github is a platform where developers all over the world store their
          code and projects and can collabrate and work from anywhere around the
          world.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong>What is branching?</strong></li>
        <div>
          Branching is used to copy a code from a main branch (master branch)
          this helps us to get access of the code individually from main
          branches and we can modify according to our needs and then we can
          create a pull request
        </div>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>What is declarative coding and imperative coding?</strong>
        </li>
        <div>
          <strong>Declarative programming:-</strong> In this programming style
          programmers are concerned with what the output will be and not how we
          will get the output. <br />
          <strong>Imperative programming:-</strong> In this programming style
          programmers are concerned with how we will get the output.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong> What are callBack functions ? </strong></li>
        <div>
          Callbacks are functions which were passed as an aruguements to another
          function without the parenthesis involved in it.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong> What is useState in react ? </strong></li>
        <div>
          With the help of useState we can update the state of a functional
          components. <br />
          useState is always declared with two array variable inside it. <br />
          <strong>Initial state:- </strong> Initial state is consisted of
          current value of useState which will be given. <br />
          <strong>updated state:- </strong> Updated state consists of the state
          which will be updated on a user input or a specific event.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong> Diffrence between semantic and Non-sematic HTML ? </strong>
        </li>
        <div>
          <strong>Semantic HTML:-</strong> Semantic HTML means HTML which has
          meaning to it. and can be read by screen readers for disabled folks.
          <br />
          e.g:- aside, aritcle, nav, section, etc <br />
          <strong>Non-Semantic HTML:-</strong> Non-semantic HTML means which has
          no meaning to it. Screen readers can't read it. <br />
          e.g:- div, span, etc.
        </div>
        <br />
        <li><strong> What is css box model ? </strong></li>
        <div>
          An element consist of several of the css layers along with the content
          itself. padding, border and margin. <br />
          <strong>Padding:-</strong> Padding are spacing within the content.
          <br />
          <strong>Borders:-</strong> Border define that the contents place has
          been ended. <br />
          <strong>Margins:-</strong> Margin are the space outside the border to
